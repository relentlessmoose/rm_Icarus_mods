Above, you have mod name and which file(s) it edits displayed.  
*Check back often for frequent updates, not just weekly.*

My mods are installed as .pak files inside ...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods  
Unzip to locate the file(s) needed.

A mix of QoL mods and difficulty increasing mods.  
Spawn additions, weather additions, stack sizes, attachment slots, modifiers, trackers, and more.  
While balance is preferred, it may not always be present.  
Always looking for new ideas.

At some point I'll record every change made and note them here.

[Total Moose Experience](https://github.com/relentlessmoose/rm_Icarus_mods/blob/main/rm_Total_Moose_Experience_P.pak) is my all-in-one.
